# Mosaic 1.0

**Mosaic 1.0** is an early prototype of a radically simple, local-first publishing tool. It was built to explore how frictionless and transparent web publishing could be if it required no setup, no account, and no backend.

This version of Mosaic focused on:
- Local-first architecture: content is stored and editable directly in the browser
- Instant publishing: write in Markdown, hit publish, and your site updates
- No accounts, no database, no hosting required
- A minimal interface inspired by the early web and the spirit of “view source”

While Mosaic 1.0 is no longer in active development, it served as an important design and UX prototype. Many of the core ideas — simplicity, ownership, inspectable structure — continue in **Mosaic 2.0**, which is being redesigned as a hosted, protocol-aligned publishing tool with support for theming, templating, and custom domains.

## Why it matters

Mosaic 1.0 was a proof of concept: a working sketch of what publishing could feel like if we removed all unnecessary friction. It is part of a broader effort to reclaim the web as a place for personal expression and creative ownership.
